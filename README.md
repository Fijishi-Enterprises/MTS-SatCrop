# Crop Classification with Multi-Temporal Satellite Imagery

This repo provides codes for crop classification using multi temporal satellite images. Crop classification is important for understanding the supplies of a crop. The satellite images can be helpful in monitoring crop growth and health in near real-time. Today, high-resolution satellite images are available at a daily frequency. With high-frequency data and multiple bands, it's possible to classify crops using deep learning.

There are many classical machine learning crop classification approaches available which use mono-temporal images and use the spectral and textural properties of a crop which results in relatively low accuracy but weâ€™ll use the method suggested by **Rose M. Rustowicz** author of the [paper](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2017/final-reports/5243811.pdf)

# Dataset
You can download the dataset used in this repo from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavesh907/crop-classificationcs2292017usgscroplanddata)

The dataset consist of 10 RapidEye satellite images provided by the [planet.com](https://www.planet.com/) and 1 USDA Cropland data layer which provides the pixel level crop labels.
